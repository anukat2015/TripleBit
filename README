Dependency:
-----------
Please install boost and raptor, you can use the following versions or other versions.

boost-1.39.0.tar.gz
raptor-1.4.21.tar.gz

Building:
---------

TripleBit must be build using GNU make and a reasonable C++ compiler. Ideally a simple

   make

is enough, it will build the tree high-level executables in bin/lrelease/.

Using:
------

TripleBit currently includes three high-level executables. The first (buildTripleBitFromN3)
is used to build a new database from an turtle/ntriples input:

   buildTripleBitFromN3 mydata.n3 database_directory

The input file can be arbitrarily large, the buildTripleBitFromN3 spools to disk if
main memory is exhausted.

The second (buildTripleBitFromRDF) is similar to the first executable except the 
input file is a rdf file.

After loading the database can be queried with triplebitQuery:

   triplebitQuery database_directory query_directory

The program shows a command prompt and accept SPARQL queries.

Note: TripleBit currently only supports "select" queries.
